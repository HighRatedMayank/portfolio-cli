👨‍💻 ABOUT :: MAYANK
──────────────────────────────────────────────
I am an aspiring software developer with a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms. My journey began with competitive programming, and I am now channeling that logic into building modern web applications. I thrive on strategy and problem-solving, which fuels both my coding sessions and my daily games of Chess. As a tech enthusiast, I am always eager to learn new tools and turn complex ideas into reality.


🎯 Always learning, building, and pushing boundaries.
